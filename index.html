                    <h2>Welcome to Thoughtful Noodle Books</h2>
                    <p>Thoughtful Noodle is a (fictionaL) imprint for (real!) books written by Brendan Shea. Here at Toughtful Noodle Books, our mission is to make philosophy and computer science textbooks accessible to everyone. All of our works are available under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license, which means that you can use, modify, and share them for any purpose. We invite instructors to use our textbooks in the classroom, and encourage them to adapt the material for their own use.</p>
                    <p>We believe that open-access works have several advantages over traditional textbooks. The most obvious benefit is that they are free, which helps to reduce the cost of education. Additionally, open-access works are more easily adapted and updated, so that instructors can quickly incorporate new research and technologies into their courses. Finally, open-access works are more transparent and collaborative, which encourages student engagement and allows for more diverse perspectives.</p>
